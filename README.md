## Background & Overview
Olist is one of Brazil’s leading e-commerce platforms that connects thousands of sellers with millions of customers nationwide. Founded with the vision to democratize online commerce, Olist has grown rapidly by offering a diverse range of products—from fashion and electronics to home goods—across its online marketplace. 

By leveraging an extensive dataset covering customer demographics, orders, payments, product performance, and reviews, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Olist’s sales and purchase operations. The primary objective is to extract actionable insights that will drive improvements in sales, product management, and marketing strategies.

## Data Cleaning & Integration
Given the heterogeneous nature of the available data—from customer information and orders to payments, product details, and reviews—a robust data cleaning and integration process is critical. This phase involves:

✅ **Data Cleaning:** Identifying and addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies (e.g., date formats, product naming conventions).

✅ **Data Integration:** Merging datasets using unique identifiers (such as `order_id` and `customer_id`) to create a unified master table for analysis.
